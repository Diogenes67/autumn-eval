    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – TOM L. (12 years 0 months)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Diagnostic clarification regarding ADHD with possible co‑occurring autism spectrum disorder.

Tom is a 12‑year‑old boy known to this practice since infancy. He carries a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation, made at age seven following persistent hyperactivity, impulsivity, and attentional difficulties across home and school settings. Despite appropriate pharmacological and educational interventions, Tom continues to experience significant functional impairment, prompting concern regarding possible co‑occurring autism spectrum disorder.

Pregnancy and birth were unremarkable. Tom was born at term with no neonatal complications. Early motor milestones were within normal limits. Language milestones were broadly on time, though parents report that Tom’s early speech was unusually formal and pedantic. There is no history of seizures or significant medical illness.

Tom was diagnosed with ADHD after several years of behavioural difficulties at school, including interrupting, leaving his seat, emotional outbursts, and difficulty sustaining attention. Stimulant medication has led to clear improvement in core ADHD symptoms, particularly activity level and classroom engagement. However, ongoing concerns persist that are not fully explained by ADHD alone.

These include marked rigidity, distress with unexpected change, narrow and intense interests that dominate conversation, sensory sensitivities (particularly to noise and clothing textures), and ongoing peer relationship difficulties. Teachers report that even when attention is improved, Tom struggles with reciprocal conversation, interpreting social cues, and adapting to group work.

Parents report increasing anxiety, particularly related to school and social situations. Tom frequently complains of stomach aches before school and seeks repeated reassurance. Emotional regulation remains fragile, with episodes of shutdown or explosive distress when overwhelmed.

Family history is notable for attentional difficulties in the father and an autism diagnosis in a maternal cousin.

Clinical impression is ADHD with additional neurodevelopmental features suggestive of possible autism spectrum disorder or Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, with comorbid anxiety. A comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment is requested to clarify diagnosis and guide ongoing supports.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `TEACHER REPORT – TOM L.

Tom is an intelligent and curious student who presents with ongoing difficulties in attention, behaviour, and social functioning.

In class, Tom remains distractible and impulsive, though medication has reduced the severity of these behaviours. More striking are his social communication difficulties. Tom often dominates discussions with lengthy monologues about preferred topics and struggles to notice when peers lose interest.

Group work is challenging. Tom becomes rigid about rules and procedures and may argue intensely if others do not follow his interpretation. He has difficulty reading sarcasm or humour and takes comments literally. This has led to peer conflict and teasing.

Tom becomes highly distressed by timetable changes, substitute teachers, or altered routines. Noise sensitivity is significant; assemblies and busy classrooms lead to visible distress.

Academically, Tom performs at or above age level when tasks are structured. Open‑ended tasks and ambiguous instructions increase anxiety and avoidance.

Tom requires ongoing support, and diagnostic clarification would assist in tailoring appropriate accommodations.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – TOM L.

Tom has always been bright, intense, and exhausting. As a toddler he could focus on certain interests for hours but struggled with flexibility and frustration.

The ADHD diagnosis helped explain his hyperactivity and impulsivity, but it never fully explained why social life remained so hard even after medication helped his attention. Tom desperately wants friends but does not seem to understand how friendships work.

He talks constantly about his interests and becomes upset if interrupted. He struggles with jokes and takes things very literally. Changes to routine cause major distress. Noise and clothing textures overwhelm him.

Tom is increasingly anxious and hard on himself. He says other kids think he is weird. We are worried about his mental health and want a clear explanation that fits the whole picture, not just ADHD.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – TOM L.

Tom demonstrates age‑appropriate vocabulary and grammar but significant pragmatic language vulnerabilities.

Conversational reciprocity is limited. Tom frequently monologues, interrupts, and fails to monitor listener engagement. Topic shifting is difficult, particularly when discussing preferred interests.

Tom interprets language literally and struggles with figurative language and sarcasm. Perspective‑taking and repair strategies are weak under stress.

Findings are consistent with a social communication disorder and are commonly seen in autism spectrum disorder. ADHD alone does not fully account for the observed pragmatic profile.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – TOM L.

Tom presents with a complex neurodevelopmental profile. ADHD symptoms are well established and partially responsive to medication.

Autism‑related features include rigidity, restricted interests, sensory sensitivities, and persistent social‑communication difficulties. These features are evident across settings and remain impairing even when attentional control is improved.

Anxiety is a significant comorbid factor and exacerbates behavioural dysregulation.

Overall presentation is consistent with ADHD with co‑occurring autism spectrum disorder (Level 1) or closely related phenotype. Multidisciplinary diagnostic confirmation is recommended.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – TOM L.

Tom’s family is supportive but under strain from ongoing school difficulties and behavioural crises.

Repeated school incidents have damaged Tom’s self‑esteem and increased family stress. Parents report feeling blamed rather than supported.

Tom is vulnerable to bullying and social isolation. Without clear diagnostic formulation and coordinated planning, there is risk of worsening anxiety and disengagement.

Family would benefit from coordinated supports, school advocacy, and mental health planning.

  "George": [
    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – GEORGE K. (3 years 2 months)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Assessment of global developmental delay with consideration of autism spectrum disorder.

George is a 3-year-2-month-old boy referred due to significant developmental delays across multiple domains, limited expressive language, and behavioural distress. Early childhood educators and family have queried possible autism spectrum disorder.

George was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. There were no neonatal complications. Medical history is notable for recurrent otitis media in early childhood. There is no history of seizures or major illness.

Developmentally, George sat at approximately nine months and walked independently at around twenty months. Fine motor skills are delayed. Language delay is significant, with fewer than twenty consistent spoken words. Communication relies heavily on gesture and taking an adult by the hand.

Despite delays, George shows social interest. He seeks comfort, enjoys physical affection, responds to his name most of the time, and engages in simple social games. Joint attention is emerging but inconsistent.

Behavioural concerns include distress with transitions, sensory sensitivities to noise and clothing, and repetitive object use, particularly twirling a cord for self-regulation.

Clinical impression is global developmental delay with sensory regulation difficulties. Autism remains a differential diagnosis but is not clearly established. Multidisciplinary assessment is requested to guide early intervention planning.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATOR REPORT – GEORGE K.

George attends daycare four mornings per week. He is generally gentle and affectionate with educators.

Communication is primarily nonverbal. George points, pulls adults by the hand, and vocalises to express needs. He follows simple instructions with gesture support.

George engages in parallel play and imitates peers in simple activities. He seeks adult attention and enjoys shared routines.

Transitions and noise are challenging. George becomes distressed during group singing or sudden changes. He frequently twirls a cord for comfort.

Overall, George appears socially interested but developmentally delayed. Guidance is requested regarding appropriate supports.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – GEORGE K.

George is a loving little boy who wants to connect but cannot yet communicate well.

He was late to walk and talk and becomes frustrated easily. When he cannot express himself he screams or throws himself on the floor.

George enjoys cuddles, brings toys to show us, and plays peekaboo. He responds to his name at home and copies simple actions.

We are worried about his development and want to know whether this is autism or a broader delay, and what therapies will help him most.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – GEORGE K.

George presents with significant expressive and receptive language delay.

He understands simple routine language with gestures. Expressive communication consists of a few words, sounds, pointing, and leading behaviour.

Social communication intent is present. Joint attention and imitation are emerging. Repetitive object use appears regulatory rather than stereotyped.

Profile is consistent with developmental language disorder within global developmental delay. Autism is not clearly supported from a speech-language perspective.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – GEORGE K.

Assessment indicates delays across cognitive, language, and motor domains.

George demonstrates social engagement appropriate to developmental level, including shared enjoyment and comfort-seeking.

Repetitive behaviours and sensory sensitivities are present but not disproportionate to overall delay.

Findings support global developmental delay. Autism spectrum disorder cannot be confirmed at this time.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – GEORGE K.

George’s parents are engaged and motivated but under stress due to frequent meltdowns and uncertainty.

Early intervention access and coordinated care are priorities. Family would benefit from clear guidance and service navigation support.

  "Lindsey": [
    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – LINDSEY M. (4 years 8 months)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Persistent non-speaking behaviour in preschool with concern for autism spectrum disorder versus anxiety/selective mutism.

Lindsey is a 4-year-8-month-old girl referred following concerns raised by preschool staff regarding minimal verbal participation, social withdrawal, and lack of engagement in the classroom. Parents report a marked discrepancy between Lindsey’s functioning at home and at preschool.

Pregnancy, birth, and early development were unremarkable. Lindsey met motor and language milestones on time and demonstrated early fluent speech. There is no history of developmental regression. Medical history is non-contributory.

At home, Lindsey is described as chatty, imaginative, and socially engaged. She uses complex sentences, engages in pretend play, demonstrates empathy, and maintains appropriate eye contact with familiar adults and peers.

In preschool, Lindsey does not speak to staff, avoids group participation, and may freeze when addressed. She communicates through gesture and nodding. This behaviour appears context-specific and anxiety-driven rather than global.

There are no reports of repetitive behaviours, restricted interests, or sensory sensitivities. Lindsey tolerates routine changes at home and in familiar settings.

Family history is notable for anxiety disorders.

Clinical impression is selective mutism/social anxiety. Autism spectrum disorder is considered unlikely. Multidisciplinary assessment is requested to confirm diagnosis and guide school-based supports.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `PRESCHOOL TEACHER REPORT – LINDSEY M.

Lindsey is a quiet child who attends preschool five mornings per week.

She does not speak to educators and rarely responds verbally when addressed. She communicates using nodding, shaking her head, or pointing. When attention is directed to her, she becomes visibly tense and avoids eye contact.

Lindsey observes peers closely and appears interested but rarely joins play. She prefers solitary activities such as puzzles and drawing.

She follows routines well and does not display distress with changes. No repetitive movements or fixated interests have been observed.

Our concern is the persistence of silence rather than social understanding. Guidance is requested on how to support Lindsey without increasing anxiety.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – LINDSEY M.

Lindsey is talkative, creative, and expressive at home. She tells stories, plays pretend games, and asks many questions.

She becomes silent in unfamiliar or high-pressure situations. At preschool she does not speak at all. This is not defiance; she appears frightened and frozen.

Lindsey understands social situations and shows empathy. She has friends outside preschool with whom she speaks after a long warm-up.

We believe Lindsey is anxious rather than autistic and want support that helps her feel safe at school without labelling her incorrectly.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – LINDSEY M.

Lindsey demonstrates age-appropriate receptive and expressive language skills in low-anxiety contexts.

When comfortable, she uses complex sentences, appropriate grammar, and pragmatic skills including turn-taking and repair.

In anxiety-provoking contexts, Lindsey becomes silent. This pattern is consistent with selective mutism.

There is no evidence of a primary language or social communication disorder. Autism spectrum disorder is not supported from a speech-language perspective.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – LINDSEY M.

Lindsey presents with context-specific speech inhibition, social freezing, and avoidance consistent with selective mutism and social anxiety.

Social reciprocity, pretend play, empathy, and nonverbal communication are intact in comfortable settings.

There is minimal evidence of autism-related features. Silence in assessment contexts can inflate autism screening tools and must be interpreted cautiously.

Diagnosis of selective mutism is most consistent with current findings.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – LINDSEY M.

Lindsey’s family is engaged and seeking appropriate support.

School-based anxiety has impacted Lindsey’s participation but not her social understanding.

A coordinated plan focusing on anxiety reduction, graded exposure, and staff education is recommended to prevent mislabelling and escalation.

  "Ethan": [
    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – ETHAN M. (10 years 4 months)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Review of neurodevelopmental diagnosis and current needs; clarification of ASD status given marked improvement and potential loss of supports.

Ethan was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at 2 years 11 months through an early childhood developmental service. At the time, parents reported limited functional language, reduced response to name, minimal pointing/joint attention, repetitive lining up of objects, distress with changes, and sensory sensitivities. He received intensive early intervention including speech therapy, parent-mediated behavioural support, and specialist preschool placement.

Over the years Ethan has made substantial gains. School staff are now questioning whether he continues to meet ASD criteria, and parents are requesting a formal review to avoid premature withdrawal of supports and to guide how Ethan understands his developmental history.

Perinatal history was unremarkable. He was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. There was no NICU admission. He has no history of seizures or significant head injury. Medical history is notable only for mild eczema in infancy. He is not currently on medication. Sleep has historically been difficult, with delayed settling and anticipatory anxiety before novel events. Diet was previously restricted but is now broader, though some texture aversions persist.

Early developmental history included significant language delay, with limited two‑word combinations until approximately 3½ years. Motor milestones were within typical range, though parents describe clumsiness and avoidance of team sports. Social development in early childhood was characterised by solitary play and strong preference for predictability. Parents report a notable developmental surge between ages four and seven with therapy and supportive schooling.

Currently, Ethan functions well in many areas. Socially, he has two close friends and participates in small group activities. He can sustain reciprocal conversation when calm and shows empathy, particularly within the family. However, he remains vulnerable to subtle social cues and can become pedantic about fairness. Communication is fluent, but difficulties with inference, figurative language, and summarising information persist.

Behaviourally, distress around unexpected change remains a challenge, though meltdowns have largely been replaced by shutdowns and avoidance. Sensory sensitivity to noise persists, and Ethan regularly uses ear defenders for assemblies. Executive function difficulties are prominent, particularly disorganisation, forgetfulness, and difficulty initiating tasks.

Anxiety is a significant contributor to Ethan’s presentation. Parents report anticipatory worry, reassurance seeking, and somatic complaints before stressful events. There is no current evidence of self‑harm, but Ethan can express negative self‑beliefs when overwhelmed.

Family history includes attentional difficulties in the father and dyslexia in a maternal uncle. There are no current safeguarding concerns.

My clinical impression is that Ethan has a clear neurodevelopmental history with early ASD diagnosis. His current presentation may reflect ASD with substantial improvement, Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder with anxiety and executive dysfunction, or subthreshold autistic traits. A multidisciplinary reassessment is requested to clarify diagnosis and guide ongoing supports.

I request comprehensive MDT assessment, including review of early developmental history, current adaptive functioning, pragmatic language evaluation, and school observation where feasible, with a clear needs‑based formulation.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `TEACHER REPORT – ETHAN M.

Ethan is an able student who generally appears settled in class, though his profile is distinctive. He is highly literal, fairness‑driven, and becomes stuck when tasks are ambiguous or when he fears being wrong.

Academically, Ethan reads accurately and retains factual information well. Difficulties arise with comprehension tasks requiring inference. Written work can be detailed but disorganised, and he often over‑edits. He frequently seeks reassurance and may freeze if instructions are unclear. With checklists and examples, performance improves.

Attention difficulties are evident through daydreaming and slow task initiation rather than disruptive behaviour. Ethan forgets materials, misses instructions, and benefits from front seating and repetition.

Socially, Ethan maintains a small friendship group and cooperates in structured activities. In unstructured contexts he becomes rigid about rules and may misinterpret peers’ intentions as unfair or hostile. He is remorseful after conflicts but struggles to explain social misunderstandings.

Noise sensitivity is prominent. Ethan covers his ears during assemblies and prefers quiet spaces. Unexpected timetable changes cause visible anxiety, mitigated by advance warning.

Ethan is kind, honest, and reliable in predictable roles. He benefits from continued structured support, and diagnostic clarification would assist in planning appropriate accommodations.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – ETHAN M.

Ethan was diagnosed with autism as a toddler, and at that time the diagnosis clearly fit. He spoke very little, avoided eye contact, lined objects up, and became distressed by small changes. Early intervention made an enormous difference.

Now Ethan appears “too capable” for people to take his remaining difficulties seriously. He is affectionate, humorous, and articulate, but still struggles deeply with uncertainty, social nuance, and sensory overload.

He asks repetitive questions when anxious and cannot start tasks if he fears being wrong. He takes language literally and misreads jokes. Socially he is better one‑to‑one than in groups and can become either withdrawn or bossy.

Noise remains a major trigger. Clothing textures still bother him. Anxiety is significant, and he is very hard on himself when he struggles.

We are worried about supports being removed because Ethan looks fine on the surface. We want a clear explanation that recognises his growth without dismissing his ongoing needs, and guidance on how to help him understand his own history.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – ETHAN M.

Ethan presents with fluent structural language but ongoing pragmatic vulnerabilities. Vocabulary and grammar are age‑appropriate, but higher‑order language skills are weaker.

He struggles with inference, figurative language, and summarising narratives. Conversation can become detail‑heavy, and he does not consistently monitor listener interest. Repair strategies are limited under stress.

Eye contact and gestures are adequate in structured settings but reduce when Ethan is anxious. Sensory sensitivity and rigidity contribute to pragmatic breakdown.

The profile is consistent with either mild ASD or Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder with anxiety. Ongoing pragmatic language support is recommended regardless of diagnostic outcome.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – ETHAN M.

Ethan demonstrates significant developmental progress since early childhood, but subtle neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities persist.

Current assessment indicates average to high verbal reasoning with weaker executive functions. Adaptive skills remain below expectation for cognitive ability, particularly organisation and coping with change.

Autism‑specific observation shows adequate reciprocity and social motivation, with limited current repetitive behaviours. Anxiety and executive dysfunction are prominent contributors.

At present, Ethan does not clearly meet full ASD criteria, though subthreshold traits remain. Supports should be needs‑based, and anxiety intervention is strongly recommended.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – ETHAN M.

Ethan’s family is stable and supportive but under strain from advocacy demands. There is risk that supports will be withdrawn due to Ethan’s improved presentation, despite ongoing vulnerability.

Ethan internalises distress and is unlikely to draw attention to difficulties. Without accommodations, anxiety and shutdown are likely to escalate.

A needs‑based plan is essential, with clear documentation to support school advocacy and prevent service withdrawal. Parental support and coordination remain important.

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Review of autism spectrum disorder profile in adolescence with escalating anxiety, self-injury, and functional communication difficulties.

Jessica has a longstanding diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, made at age two following significant language delay, atypical social engagement, sensory sensitivities, and rigidity. She has remained in supported educational settings throughout childhood. The family is requesting reassessment to clarify current level of need and to guide adolescent transition planning.

Jessica has no history of epilepsy or significant medical illness. Puberty has recently commenced, with associated increases in emotional lability and distress. Sleep is disrupted with delayed onset and early waking. Diet remains highly selective but nutritionally adequate. She is not currently prescribed psychotropic medication.

Functionally, Jessica continues to demonstrate marked social-communication impairment. Speech is limited to short phrases and scripts. She struggles to express emotions and internal states, and distress is frequently communicated behaviourally.

Current concerns include escalating anxiety, avoidance of noisy environments, increased rigidity, and self-injurious behaviours including lip picking and occasional head hitting during meltdowns. Sensory sensitivity to noise and touch is prominent.

Family circumstances are stable and supportive, but caregiver strain is significant.

Clinical impression is autism spectrum disorder with moderate support needs and comorbid anxiety. Multidisciplinary reassessment is requested to inform communication supports, behavioural planning, and transition services.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `TEACHER REPORT – JESSICA R.

Jessica attends a supported secondary education program and requires consistent adult assistance.

Communication is limited and heavily scaffolded. Jessica uses short phrases and scripted language. During distress her speech reduces or ceases entirely. Visual supports are essential.

Social understanding is limited. Jessica seeks proximity to peers but does not read social cues, leading to conflict. Peer relationships are fragile and adult-mediated.

Distress behaviours include crying, dropping to the floor, yelling, and self-injury during overload. Triggers include assemblies, crowded corridors, and unexpected changes.

Jessica benefits from predictable routines, a calm space, and trusted adults. Academic progress is slow but steady within a highly structured environment.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – JESSICA R.

Jessica has been autistic since early childhood, and adolescence has made everything harder.

Jessica is affectionate and enjoys family routines, but communication is very limited. She cannot explain what she feels or what has gone wrong at school. This leads to anxiety and meltdowns.

Noise and change are major triggers. Self-injury has increased, especially lip picking until bleeding. Puberty has intensified emotional responses.

We are exhausted and worried about safety and the future. We need better communication tools, anxiety management, and coordinated planning so crises are prevented rather than reacted to.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – JESSICA R.

Jessica presents with severe expressive and receptive language impairment and significant pragmatic limitations.

Speech is limited to short phrases and echolalic scripts. Comprehension is restricted to familiar, concrete language. Communication breakdown frequently precedes behavioural escalation.

AAC supports are strongly indicated to increase functional communication and reduce distress. Visual schedules and choice systems are beneficial.

Language profile is consistent with autism spectrum disorder with moderate support needs.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – JESSICA R.

Jessica meets criteria for autism spectrum disorder with persistent social-communication deficits, rigidity, and sensory sensitivity.

Self-injurious behaviour appears driven by anxiety and inability to communicate distress. Behaviour functions primarily as escape from overload.

Anxiety has escalated during adolescence. Adaptive functioning remains significantly impaired.

Recommendations include autism-informed anxiety intervention, functional behaviour support, and communication-based prevention strategies.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – JESSICA R.

Jessica’s family provides consistent care but is under significant strain.

Jessica is vulnerable due to limited communication and reduced understanding of risk. Self-injury and distress behaviours increase caregiver burden.

Coordinated planning, respite supports, and transition pathway development are essential to maintain safety and family sustainability.

  "Brandon": [
    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – BRANDON S. (15 years 7 months)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Severe functional impairment with autism spectrum disorder and comorbid anxiety/depression; request integrated neurodevelopmental and mental health formulation.

Brandon has a documented diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder from age seven, with longstanding sensory sensitivities, rigidity, restricted interests, and social communication differences. He was later diagnosed with Generalised Anxiety Disorder at age eight and Major Depressive Disorder at age twelve. Over the past 12 to 18 months, Brandon’s functional capacity has deteriorated significantly.

Brandon has no history of seizures or significant medical illness. Sleep is markedly dysregulated with delayed sleep phase. Appetite is inconsistent. He often refuses routine medical care due to sensory aversion. Previous medication trials have included an SSRI and stimulant medication, both discontinued due to intolerance and refusal. He is currently not taking psychotropic medication.

Developmentally, Brandon spoke on time but with atypical pragmatics, including formal speech and monologues. Sensory sensitivities were evident from early childhood. Peer relationships have always been difficult, with escalating bullying and social isolation in later primary school.

Currently, Brandon is largely housebound and attends school minimally. He exhibits extreme anxiety responses to demand, including panic, shutdown, and elopement behaviour. During episodes of distress he may become nonverbal and unresponsive to verbal prompts. He demonstrates marked self-neglect, including avoidance of hygiene and erratic eating.

Risk concerns include repeated elopement episodes with associated accidental harm risk, significant school refusal, and depressive symptoms. Brandon expresses hopelessness though denies active suicidal planning; reliability of self-report is limited.

Family circumstances are strained, with mother providing constant supervision. There are active conflicts with school regarding attendance expectations.

Clinical impression is autism spectrum disorder with severe anxiety and depressive features, profound functional impairment, and high safeguarding risk due to elopement and self-neglect. Urgent multidisciplinary intervention is required.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `TEACHER REPORT – BRANDON S.

Brandon is enrolled in mainstream secondary education but is functionally unable to access schooling. Attendance is extremely limited, with gradual reduction from full timetable to brief, supervised visits.

When Brandon attends, he requires a quiet environment and a trusted adult. Any deviation from the agreed plan leads to distress, shutdown, or abrupt departure from site. On several occasions Brandon has bolted from the school grounds.

Brandon’s academic ability is high when he engages independently, particularly in mathematics and computing. In person, anxiety overwhelms his capacity to demonstrate knowledge.

Communication deteriorates under stress, with Brandon becoming nonverbal or using minimal phrases. He avoids eye contact and appears physically tense. He uses noise-cancelling headphones and requires explicit, literal instructions.

Peer interaction is avoided entirely. Brandon reports feeling unsafe around other students despite lack of current threat. Historical bullying appears to contribute to hypervigilance.

This student requires a therapeutic education approach. Standard attendance expectations are not currently realistic.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – BRANDON S.

Brandon is highly intelligent and profoundly overwhelmed. His autism diagnosis made sense early on, but adolescence has intensified every vulnerability.

As a child Brandon was sensitive to noise, rigid, and socially naïve. Secondary school pressures triggered escalating anxiety. Over the past two years he has become increasingly avoidant, refusing school and leaving the house only with difficulty.

Brandon experiences panic when demands are placed. He may shut down completely or run away to escape distress. He has bolted from home multiple times and becomes unreachable when overwhelmed.

Self-care has deteriorated. Brandon avoids showering, toothbrushing, and changing clothes due to sensory discomfort and hopelessness. Sleep is reversed. Eating is erratic.

We have tried therapy and medication, but Brandon refuses engagement. School accommodations have not been sufficient. I work from home to supervise him because he cannot be left alone safely.

We need a realistic plan that recognises Brandon’s autism, severe anxiety, and current incapacity. Without coordinated support, his future is at serious risk.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – BRANDON S.

Brandon demonstrates advanced structural language skills with significant pragmatic impairment. Speech becomes inaccessible during anxiety-driven shutdown.

He uses formal, technical language and monologues on preferred topics. Reciprocal conversation is limited. He interprets language literally and becomes distressed by ambiguity.

Nonverbal communication is minimal, particularly eye contact and gesture. Under stress Brandon becomes nonverbal and may leave the environment.

Communication breakdown is anxiety-mediated rather than linguistic. Written communication is often more accessible than speech.

This profile is consistent with autism spectrum disorder with severe anxiety-related functional communication impairment.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – BRANDON S.

Brandon presents with autism spectrum disorder and severe comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms. Intelligence is high, but functional capacity is extremely low.

Anxiety responses include panic, avoidance, shutdown, and elopement. Demand escalates symptoms rather than improving compliance. Depression is suggested by hopelessness, anhedonia, and self-neglect.

Risk is high due to elopement, accidental harm, social isolation, and poor engagement with services. Traditional outpatient models are insufficient.

A coordinated, autism-informed, low-demand mental health and education plan is urgently required.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – BRANDON S.

Brandon’s family is carrying an unsustainable level of risk and supervision. His mother provides near-constant oversight due to elopement risk.

School attendance processes have increased distress. Brandon is framed as refusing rather than being unable to cope.

Brandon is socially isolated and disengaged from services. Without integrated support, there is risk of family burnout and long-term disengagement from education.

Multiagency coordination, respite planning, and safeguarding-by-vulnerability are essential.

  "Noah": [
    { title: "GP Report", text: `GP REPORT – NOAH P. (7 years 1 month)

To: Central Neurodevelopmental Assessment Team
From: General Practitioner
Reason for referral: Review of autism spectrum disorder and ADHD formulation following significant functional improvement.

Noah was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder at age four following language delay, sensory sensitivities, repetitive play, and reduced peer engagement. At age six he was additionally diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, combined presentation. Over the past twelve months, following coordinated therapy and medication optimisation, Noah has made marked gains in academic, social, and emotional functioning.

Noah was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. There is no history of seizures or significant medical illness. Early childhood was notable for poor sleep and feeding selectivity. He is currently prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD with good effect and tolerable side effects.

Early development included limited spoken language, reduced joint attention, strong distress with transitions, and repetitive play behaviours. Sensory sensitivities to noise and clothing were prominent.

Currently, Noah attends mainstream schooling with supports. He is reading at grade level, participating in group activities, and forming peer relationships. Meltdowns have reduced in frequency and intensity. He independently uses coping strategies such as noise reduction and calm spaces.

Residual vulnerabilities include sensory overload, literal interpretation of language, difficulty with peer conflict, and organisational challenges. Anxiety and perfectionism are emerging concerns.

Clinical impression is that Noah continues to demonstrate autism-related traits with ADHD contributing to impulsivity and regulation difficulties. Continued supports are recommended regardless of diagnostic threshold.

Multidisciplinary reassessment is requested to guide ongoing educational and therapeutic planning.
` },
    { title: "Teacher Report", text: `TEACHER REPORT – NOAH P.

Noah has shown remarkable progress this year. He is now an enthusiastic learner and participates actively in class when structure is provided.

Academically, Noah’s reading and writing have improved significantly. He benefits from explicit instructions and short work segments. Attention and impulsivity remain present but are manageable with supports.

Socially, Noah initiates play and is learning turn-taking. He remains vulnerable to misinterpreting others’ intentions and can escalate conflicts quickly.

Noise sensitivity persists. Assemblies and crowded spaces increase dysregulation. Advance warning and sensory supports are effective.

Despite improvements, Noah continues to require structured support. Removal of accommodations would likely result in regression.
` },
    { title: "Parent Report", text: `PARENT REPORT – NOAH P.

Noah’s progress has been extraordinary, but it reflects the success of supports rather than the absence of need.

As a young child Noah barely spoke, avoided peers, and melted down over sensory input and changes. Autism and ADHD diagnoses helped us understand him.

With the right teacher, therapies, and medication, Noah now enjoys school, has friends, and reads independently. However, sensory sensitivities, anxiety, and literal thinking remain.

We worry that improvements will be misinterpreted as Noah no longer needing support. He still becomes overwhelmed when demands increase.

We want guidance that recognises both his growth and his ongoing vulnerabilities.
` },
    { title: "Speech Pathologist Report", text: `SPEECH PATHOLOGY REPORT – NOAH P.

Noah is verbally fluent but continues to show pragmatic language vulnerabilities.

He struggles with inference, narrative organisation, and conversational repair. Impulsivity contributes to turn-taking difficulties.

Pragmatic breakdown increases under sensory overload or emotional stress. Supports targeting perspective-taking and conflict language are recommended.
` },
    { title: "Child Psychologist Report", text: `CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST REPORT – NOAH P.

Noah’s early developmental history was consistent with autism spectrum disorder. Current presentation shows substantial improvement but persistent vulnerabilities.

Autism-related traits include sensory sensitivity, rigidity under stress, literal interpretation, and social misreading. ADHD contributes to impulsivity and executive dysfunction.

At present Noah likely continues to meet criteria for ASD at a milder level. Regardless, needs-based supports are essential to maintain progress.

Proactive planning for increasing social and organisational demands is recommended.
` },
    { title: "Social Worker Report", text: `SOCIAL WORK REPORT – NOAH P.

Noah’s family has experienced significant stress historically, with notable improvement following coordinated supports.

There is risk that service withdrawal due to visible improvement could destabilise Noah’s functioning.

Clear documentation of ongoing needs and school accommodations is essential to sustain gains and prevent relapse.

Developmental and Cognitive Evaluation

CLIENT INFORMATION

REASON FOR ASSESSMENT

I.A. was referred for comprehensive developmental and cognitive assessment due to concerns about social development, language delays, and atypical behavioral patterns. This assessment is part of a longitudinal study and diagnostic evaluation for possible Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Object permanence battery

Visual paired comparison task

Delayed response task (working memory)

Naturalistic observation of free play with mother

Follow-up Assessment (24 months)

Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G), Module 1

Mullen Scales of Early Learning

ASSESSMENT RESULTS

Initial Assessment at 13-15 Months

Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R):

Total Score: 27.5 (clearly meets diagnostic criteria for autism)

Specific Deficits Identified:

Social Interaction Domain:

Failure to use direct gaze, social smiling, and range of facial expressions

No interest in other children; does not respond to other children's approaches

Lack of showing and directing attention; does not seek to share enjoyment

Abnormal quality of social overtures and inappropriate social responses

Communication Domain:

Absence of pointing, conventional gestures, nodding, and head shaking

Lack of spontaneous imitation and social imitative play

Repetitive Behaviors Domain:

Complex stereotyped mannerisms

Repetitive use of objects

Cognitive Assessment (13-15 months):

Nonverbal cognitive ability (Bayley visual-spatial tasks): Functioning at 13-month level, approximately at chronological age. No evidence of generalized developmental delay.

Free Play Observation:

Very little eye contact; rarely visually referenced mother's face

Attention primarily focused on toys

Pulled away when mother initiated interaction, appearing avoidant

Vocalized frequently but not directed toward mother, even when distressed

No use of gestures, pointing, showing of objects, or alternating gaze

Short attention span with active exploration of toys

Became overstimulated and ran in circles with repetitive vocalizations

Actively avoided face-to-face interaction when toys removed

Mild resistance to being held

Enjoyed physical stimulation (being swung) with appropriate smiling and laughing

Did not request help or make eye contact when needed assistance

Joint Attention Assessment:

Using Early Social Communication Scales:

Failed to initiate or respond to any joint attention behaviors

No pointing or showing, except rare instances of alternating gaze

Brief interactive play only when highly structured and repetitive

Failed to follow examiner's gazes or points (performance at or below preschool ASD level)

Social Orienting:

Failed to orient to social stimuli 50% of the time (2 of 4 trials)

Failed to orient to nonsocial stimuli 25% of the time (1 of 4 trials)

Performance comparable to preschool-aged children with autism.

Motor Imitation and Object Permanence:

Performed well on structured imitation tasks, including novel acts (head touch to activate object)

Passed A-not-B test and borderline pass on serial visible displacement

Startled at sounds he made himself (atypical response)

Extremely attentive to object movements and workings

Neuropsychological Testing:

Visual Paired Comparison: Chose novel object 4 of 6 trials (below expected; typical infants choose novel almost always)

Delayed Response Task: Made no errors on reversal trials (good working memory and response inhibition)

Follow-up Assessment at 24 Months

Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G):

Qualified for diagnosis of autism based on empirically validated algorithm.

Mullen Scales of Early Learning (24 months):

CLINICAL INTERPRETATION

I.A. presents with a clear and consistent pattern of deficits across both assessment periods that meet full diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder. Key findings include:

Diagnostic Certainty:

Met ADI-R criteria at 13 months (total score 27.5)

Met ADOS-G criteria at 24 months

Symptoms evident across all three core domains (social, communication, restricted/repetitive behaviors)

Cognitive Profile:

Relative strengths in visual-spatial processing and fine motor skills

Significant verbal-nonverbal discrepancy (characteristic ASD pattern)

Apparent cognitive decline from 12th percentile at 13 months to 1st percentile at 24 months

Decline likely reflects increasing difficulties with communication and symbolic functioning rather than true cognitive regression

Preserved abilities in immediate memory, working memory, and response inhibition

Social-Communicative Deficits:

Profound impairment in joint attention (core ASD feature)

Failure to engage in social referencing or shared enjoyment

Minimal eye contact with avoidance of face-to-face interaction

Absence of communicative gestures (pointing, showing, conventional gestures)

Impaired social orienting, particularly to social stimuli

Important Clinical Observations:

Performs significantly better in highly structured, predictable situations

Can imitate in structured settings but fails to engage in spontaneous social imitation

Becomes overstimulated with multiple stimuli or less structured environments

Shows enjoyment during physical play (being swung) despite social avoidance

DIAGNOSIS

Autism Spectrum Disorder (DSM-5 299.00)

Severity Level: Requiring substantial support (Level 2-3) for social communication and requiring support (Level 1-2) for restricted, repetitive behaviors

RECOMMENDATIONS

Intensive early intervention services with focus on social communication and joint attention

Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) or similar evidence-based intervention

Speech-language therapy with emphasis on pragmatic language and functional communication

Occupational therapy for sensory processing and motor difficulties

Parent training in naturalistic developmental interventions

Highly structured, predictable learning environments

Ongoing developmental monitoring and re-assessment in 12 months

Family support and connection with autism support organizations

For Autism Spectrum Disorder Assessment

CHILD INFORMATION

PURPOSE OF REPORT

This report provides observations of I.A.'s behavior, social interactions, communication, and developmental progress in our early learning setting to assist with assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder. Observations have been conducted over the past 6 months during various activities and routines.

SOCIAL INTERACTION AND PEER RELATIONSHIPS

General Social Engagement:

I.A. predominantly plays alone and shows minimal interest in other children

Does not seek out peers for play or interaction

Often appears unaware of other children's presence unless they directly interfere with his activity

Makes minimal eye contact with peers or educators

Does not engage in typical toddler parallel play or early social games

Response to Others:

Inconsistently responds when name is called - may require multiple attempts or physical touch

Tends to pull away or move away when educators or children approach

Does not show typical interest in showing toys or achievements to adults

Rarely seeks comfort when distressed - prefers to self-regulate in isolation

Does not wave goodbye or greet educators and children

Emotional Expression:

Limited range of facial expressions during social situations

Does not share enjoyment or excitement with others through looks or vocalizations

Shows enjoyment during physical activities (e.g., being pushed on swing) with appropriate smiling and laughing

Becomes upset when routines change or when overstimulated

COMMUNICATION

Expressive Communication:

Does not use any recognizable words

Makes various sounds and vocalizations throughout the day, but these are not directed at others

No use of gestures such as pointing, waving, or nodding/shaking head

Communicates needs primarily by taking adult's hand and pulling toward desired object

No attempts to gain attention before communicating

Receptive Communication:

Understanding of verbal instructions is very limited

Responds to 'no' when said firmly and repeatedly

Can follow simple one-step instructions when paired with gesture and visual cues (e.g., 'come here' with beckoning)

Does not respond to verbal requests without visual support

Joint Attention:

Does not point to objects of interest

Does not look where others are pointing or looking

Does not bring objects to show educators

Does not check to see if adults are watching before attempting new activities

PLAY AND LEARNING BEHAVIORS

Play Skills:

Play is primarily exploratory and sensory-based

Frequently mouths toys and objects

Enjoys manipulating objects, particularly those that spin or have moving parts

Very short attention span (1-2 minutes) with most toys

No evidence of pretend or imaginative play

Does not imitate actions or play schemes demonstrated by others

Repetitive Behaviors and Interests:

Often rocks back and forth when sitting

Occasionally observed banging head gently when frustrated

Walks on toes frequently

Shows intense interest in certain objects (e.g., wheels, spinning toys)

May run in circles when overstimulated

Becomes very focused on edges of carpets or lines on the floor

Learning Style:

Learns best in quiet, one-on-one situations with minimal distractions

Becomes overwhelmed in busy group activities

Responds better to visual cues than verbal instructions

Prefers predictable routines and becomes distressed with changes

Shows strong visual-spatial skills (good with puzzles and shape-matching)

SENSORY RESPONSES

Sensitive to loud noises - may cover ears or become distressed

Startles easily at unexpected sounds

Does not like being touched unexpectedly - may pull away or become upset

Seeks out certain textures by mouthing and touching excessively

Appears insensitive to pain - has not cried after minor bumps or falls

Very selective with foods - prefers crunchy textures

DAILY ROUTINES AND TRANSITIONS

Functions best with consistent, predictable routines

Becomes very distressed when routines change or during transitions

Drop-off and pick-up times are challenging - limited awareness of parent leaving/arriving

Requires substantial support during transitions between activities

Visual schedules have been helpful in preparing for changes

ADAPTIVE SKILLS

Not yet toilet trained

Feeds self finger foods but very selective about what will eat

Can drink from a cup with some spillage

Does not attempt to dress or undress self

Does not show awareness of personal needs (hungry, thirsty, needs nappy change)

AREAS OF STRENGTH

Good gross motor skills - climbs, runs, navigates playground equipment

Strong visual-spatial abilities - completes puzzles beyond age expectation

Good fine motor control when engaged with preferred activities

Enjoys music and movement activities

Generally healthy and physically robust

COMPARISON TO PEER GROUP

I.A.'s development is significantly different from his peers in our program. While typical 24-month-old children in our setting are beginning to engage in parallel play, using some words, responding to their names consistently, and showing interest in other children, I.A. remains quite isolated and does not demonstrate these emerging social and communication skills. His play is more repetitive and less exploratory than peers, and his response to the social environment is markedly different.

CURRENT SUPPORT STRATEGIES

Visual schedule to support transitions

Quiet space available when overstimulated

One-on-one educator support during group activities

Consistent routines maintained as much as possible

Physical prompts and modeling for learning new skills

Regular communication with family about strategies

SUMMARY AND CONCERNS

I.A. is a gentle child who requires significant support in our early learning environment. My primary concerns center on his limited social engagement, absence of functional communication, restricted play repertoire, and sensory sensitivities. Despite our best efforts with individualized support and visual strategies, I.A. continues to struggle with peer interaction and typical learning activities that his peers manage well.

I strongly support the family's pursuit of comprehensive assessment and believe that specialized intervention and support services would greatly benefit I.A.'s development. I am committed to implementing any recommended strategies and working collaboratively with specialists to support his learning and wellbeing.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any additional information or clarification about my observations.

Family Psychosocial Assessment

CLIENT INFORMATION

PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT

This psychosocial assessment was conducted to provide comprehensive information about family functioning, support systems, parental coping, and environmental factors as part of I.A.'s diagnostic evaluation for Autism Spectrum Disorder. The assessment is based on multiple home visits, parent interviews, and observation of family interactions.

FAMILY STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION

I.A. lives with both biological parents and three brothers (ages 10, 8, and 6 months) in a middle-class suburban neighborhood. Extended family, including paternal and maternal grandparents, live in the same household, providing additional support. The home is spacious, clean, and child-safe with appropriate facilities for the children.

Family Strengths:

Stable two-parent household with involved father

Extended family support readily available

Adequate financial resources

Warm, loving home environment

Parents are college-educated and highly motivated to help their child

Siblings show affection toward I.A. despite his limited reciprocation

PARENTAL UNDERSTANDING AND CONCERNS

Mother's Perspective:

Mother is I.A.'s primary caregiver and has been the first to notice and advocate for addressing his developmental differences. She is articulate, well-informed, and deeply committed to understanding I.A.'s needs. Mother reports feeling:

Concerned since early infancy about I.A.'s muscle tone fluctuations and feeding difficulties

Increasingly worried after 6 months when social responsiveness began to decrease

Frustrated by the lack of typical parent-child interaction and bonding

Exhausted from managing I.A.'s sleep difficulties and feeding challenges

Anxious about I.A.'s future and what services he will need

Relieved to finally be pursuing formal assessment after months of concerns

Guilt about wondering if she did something wrong during pregnancy or early care

Father's Perspective:

Father is employed full-time but highly involved in I.A.'s care when home. He reports:

Initially thought I.A. was just "developing at his own pace"

Now recognizes significant concerns, particularly regarding social engagement

Worries about his own motor coordination and attention issues being genetic factors

Concerned about oldest son's Asperger diagnosis and whether there's a family pattern

Committed to accessing whatever support I.A. needs

Worried about financial impact of potential therapies and services

FAMILY HISTORY AND GENETIC FACTORS

Significant family history of neurodevelopmental and mental health conditions:

Paternal Side:

Father: Motor coordination and attention problems (never formally diagnosed)

Paternal aunt: Diagnosed with OCD and depression

Maternal Side:

Mother: Reports being very shy as a child with possible social anxiety

Siblings:

Oldest brother (10): Formally diagnosed with Asperger syndrome; receives support for balance, coordination, motor planning, attention, distractibility, and anxiety

Middle brother (8): Mild social difficulties, motor coordination problems, mild language delay, attention problems, high activity level (not formally diagnosed)

Younger brother (6 months): No concerns noted to date

IMPACT ON FAMILY FUNCTIONING

Parental Stress:

Mother experiences significant daily stress managing I.A.'s needs alongside three other children

Sleep deprivation is major concern - I.A. sleeps only 8-9 hours per 24 hours with frequent waking

Feeding difficulties create mealtime stress

Constant vigilance required due to I.A.'s safety concerns (insensitivity to pain, wandering)

Parents report feeling isolated as typical toddler playgroups are difficult for I.A.

Managing appointments with multiple specialists is time-consuming and exhausting

Marital Relationship:

Parents present as united in their concern for I.A.

Mother reports feeling father doesn't always understand the day-to-day challenges

Both acknowledge having little time or energy for their relationship

Disagreements occasionally arise about whether I.A. needs formal diagnosis or will "catch up"

Overall relationship appears stable with good communication

Impact on Siblings:

Older brothers show patience and affection toward I.A.

Some frustration expressed that I.A. doesn't play with them

Oldest brother particularly understanding due to his own challenges

Parents mindful of ensuring older children receive adequate attention

Grandparents help provide individual attention to each child

SOCIAL SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES

Formal Supports:

Ongoing occupational therapy services

Pediatric neurology follow-up

Early intervention services through local program (recently initiated)

Part-time early learning placement (3 days/week)

Regular GP monitoring and referrals

Informal Supports:

Both sets of grandparents live in household - provide practical and emotional support

Mother's close friend has child with autism - provides understanding and advice

Parents have begun connecting with online autism parent support groups

Some extended family members helpful, though others minimizing concerns

Financial Resources:

Middle-class family income adequate for basic needs

Father employed full-time in stable position

Mother currently not employed to care for children

Health insurance coverage through father's employment

Concerns about affording potential intensive therapies not covered by insurance

Family eligible for NDIS funding if diagnosis confirmed

PARENT-CHILD INTERACTION

During home visit observations:

Mother-Child Interaction:

Mother demonstrates warm, nurturing approach despite limited reciprocity

Appropriately attuned to I.A.'s sensory sensitivities and preferences

Uses calm, gentle voice when interacting

Has learned to approach slowly and give warning before touching I.A.

Maintains efforts to engage despite I.A.'s avoidance

Visible emotional pain when I.A. pulls away or doesn't respond

Demonstrates appropriate expectations given developmental level

Father-Child Interaction:

Engages in more physical play which I.A. sometimes enjoys (being swung, tossed gently)

Initially appeared to expect more typical responses, now more accepting

Follows mother's lead regarding best approaches with I.A.

Shows affection and patience

PARENTAL COPING AND MENTAL HEALTH

Mother:

Reports feelings consistent with anticipatory grief and chronic stress

Some symptoms of anxiety and depression (difficulty sleeping, worry, sadness)

Not currently accessing mental health support - should be considered

Demonstrates remarkable resilience and problem-solving

Proactive in seeking help and information

Father:

Coping by focusing on practical solutions and provider role

May be minimizing emotional impact

Work provides some respite from home stress

Benefits from mother's emotional processing and information gathering

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

Safe, appropriate home environment

Middle-class suburban neighborhood with access to services

Transportation available for appointments

Close to early intervention services and medical facilities

Community generally supportive though limited autism-specific resources nearby

No evidence of abuse or neglect - parents highly attentive and protective

ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

This family demonstrates significant strengths including stable relationships, adequate resources, involved extended family, and parents who are committed, educated, and proactive about seeking help for their son. They have already begun navigating complex medical and early intervention systems and show good ability to advocate for I.A.'s needs.

Areas of concern include the significant stress on the family system, particularly the primary caregiver, the impact of managing multiple children with special needs, and the emotional toll of I.A.'s limited reciprocity in the parent-child relationship. The family history of neurodevelopmental conditions adds another layer of complexity and concern.

Parents would benefit from:

Clear diagnostic information and guidance

Connection with parent support groups and autism organizations

Information about NDIS and funding pathways

Parent training in evidence-based intervention strategies

Respite care options

Mental health support, particularly for mother

Ongoing social work support through diagnostic and intervention planning process

For Autism Spectrum Disorder Diagnostic Assessment

CLIENT INFORMATION

REASON FOR REFERRAL

I.A. was referred for comprehensive speech and language assessment as part of a multidisciplinary evaluation for suspected Autism Spectrum Disorder. Parental concerns include severely delayed language development, lack of communicative intent, and minimal verbal expression.

ASSESSMENT METHODS

Preschool Language Scale (PLS)

MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (CDI)

Clinical observation during structured and unstructured play

Parent interview and case history

Assessment of speech perception (vowel and consonant discrimination)

Pragmatic language observation

BACKGROUND INFORMATION

Parents report I.A. was socially responsive during early infancy with appropriate cooing and smiling behaviors in the first 6 months. However, concerning patterns emerged progressively:

At 9 months: Primarily guttural vocalizations with few recognizable consonants and no imitative vocal responses

At 12 months: Failed to develop pointing or other proto-declarative gestures

At 15 months: Vocabulary remained below 8-month developmental level

Current: No functional communicative language; vocalizations not directed toward others

ASSESSMENT RESULTS

Preschool Language Scale:

Interpretation:

I.A.'s overall language performance is significantly delayed, functioning at the 8-month developmental level compared to his chronological age of 24 months. This represents a 16-month delay (67% of chronological age).

MacArthur CDI Results:

Word Comprehension: Below 8-month level

Word Production: Below 8-month level

Gesture Use: Minimal to absent

Speech Perception Testing:

Using head-turning paradigm to assess speech discrimination:

Vowel discrimination (/a/ vs /i/): Passed with excellent discrimination

Consonant discrimination (/r/ vs /l/): Partial completion, more difficulty (age-appropriate pattern)

Interpretation: Speech perception abilities appear relatively intact, suggesting auditory processing is not the primary deficit.

CLINICAL OBSERVATIONS

Expressive Language:

Vocalizations present but not directed toward communication partners

Primarily guttural sounds with limited consonant repertoire

No recognizable words

Absence of babbling with consonant-vowel combinations

No vocal imitation observed

Receptive Language:

Inconsistent response to name

Limited comprehension of simple verbal commands

Can follow "give" command when paired with gesture and multiple repetitions

Does not orient reliably to verbal stimuli

Demonstrates understanding of "no" in context

Pragmatic Language and Social Communication:

Absence of joint attention behaviors

No pointing to request or share interest

Does not show objects to others

Fails to alternate gaze between object and communication partner

Minimal eye contact during interaction attempts

Does not engage in turn-taking activities

Communication primarily through physical manipulation (pulling/pushing others)

Play and Interaction:

Focuses primarily on objects rather than people

Short attention span (1-2 minutes per activity)

Does not engage in social imitative play

Avoids face-to-face interaction

Becomes overstimulated with multiple toys present

Engages in brief structured play only when highly repetitive and predictable

Oral Motor and Feeding:

History of oral-motor difficulties since infancy

Excessive mouthing of objects observed during assessment

Parents report ongoing feeding selectivity

CLINICAL SUMMARY

I.A. presents with severe delays in both expressive and receptive language development, with current functioning approximately 16 months below chronological age. More significantly, he demonstrates profound deficits in pragmatic language and social communication skills that extend beyond structural language delay.

Key findings include:

Absence of communicative intent despite presence of vocalizations

Complete absence of joint attention behaviors

Lack of gestural communication (pointing, showing, reaching to request)

Failure to develop proto-declarative communication

Relatively preserved speech perception abilities

These findings are highly consistent with the communication profile typically seen in Autism Spectrum Disorder, where pragmatic and social communication deficits are more pronounced than structural language impairments alone would predict.

RECOMMENDATIONS

Proceed with comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment for Autism Spectrum Disorder

Intensive speech-language intervention focusing on functional communication and social interaction

Consider augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies

Parent training in naturalistic communication strategies

Re-assessment in 6 months to monitor progress

Clinician: Dr Maya Chen, MBBS FRACP (Neurology)
Patient: Ethan R. (Male)
Age at assessment: 2.5 months (corrected)
Date of Service: 29-Mar-2023
Reason for referral: Feeding difficulty (poor suck–swallow coordination), fluctuating tone, sensory
reactivity.
History (parentIreported & GP letter):
- Born at 36 weeks via vertex vaginal delivery; initial jaundice treated with home phototherapy.
- Since the first weeks: variable tone (periods of stiffness with fisting/arching alternating with
hypotonia), startles during feeds, hypersensitive to touch; feeding fatigue.
- Socially responsive so far (smiles/coos), but easily overIstimulated, ‘checks out’ with
excessive noise. No seizures.
Examination:
- General: Cuddly infant, settles with firm containment.
- Neurological: Axial hypotonia with increased extremity tone; no pathologic reflexes; tremulous,
poorly graded movements (L>R). Mild tactile hypersensitivity; poor state regulation.
- Feeding: Inefficient suck–swallow–breathe coordination.
Impression:
Early oralImotor incoordination with mixed tone and sensory hypersensitivity. Monitor for
evolving neurodevelopmental concerns.
DisciplineIspecific comments & plan:
- Diagnostic thinking: Tone fluctuation, startle, and tactile hypersensitivity suggest early
sensorimotor dysregulation; no focal lesion. Reflux likely amplifies dysregulation.
- Immediate actions: OT for oralImotor and regulation; feeding plan with gastroenterology.
Parent coaching for lowIstimulation caregiving routines (quiet feeds, dim light). Red flags: colour
change, apnoea, choking events.
- FollowIup: Neurology review in 6–8 weeks, sooner if regression or paroxysmal events.

Clinician: Hannah Doyle, BOccThy
Patient: Ethan R. (Male)
Age at assessment: 4 months (corrected)
Date of Service: 12-May-2023
Assessment & Findings:
- Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS): ~25th percentile.
- Tone/handling: Easily overIstimulated, poor calming, hypertonic extremities; spasticity
elicitable on quick stretch.
- Social response intact in brief, smiling/cooing to adult interaction; vocalizes during play.
Feeding & Regulation:
Persistent refluxIlike behaviors (arching, refusal) around feeds. Sleep unsettled.
Clinical Impressions:
Immature sensorimotor integration and state regulation with oralImotor dyscoordination
impacting feeding; benefits from predictable, graded input.
DisciplineIspecific plan:
- ShortIterm goals (8–10 weeks):
1) Transition from alert to calm in ≤10 minutes using a 3Istep routine (linear rocking → deep
pressure → quiet feed).
2) Tolerate 10 minutes of supported prone play with reduced startle and stable head control.
3) Accept 2 additional bottle nipples/textures without arching/refusal across 3 consecutive days.
- Home programme: Stimulus capping (1–2 toys); firm containment; avoid unexpected touch;
narrate transitions.
- Feeding: Upright/sideIlying, paced; frequent pauses; trial thickened feeds per gastro plan.
- Coordination: Weekly OT; liaise with paediatrician and SLP for early communication scaffolds.

Procedures:
Overnight polysomnography with simultaneous esophageal pH monitoring.
Results:
- No apneic or bradycardic events recorded.
- Significant acid reflux temporally associated with HR decelerations, crying, irritability.
Interpretation:
Findings consistent with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux contributing to feed aversion and
fragmented sleep.
DisciplineIspecific plan (to primary paediatrician):
- Positioning postIfeed; consider feed thickener and smaller, more frequent feeds.
- If persistent symptoms/poor growth: trial acid suppression per local protocol; monitor
response/side effects.
- Sleep hygiene: consistent bedtime routine; minimise nocturnal stimulation.
- Monitoring: Weight/growth checks; swallow risk review if cough/aspiration symptoms develop.

Date of Service: 13-Oct-2023
Interim history:
Tolerates purees; lumpy textures not accepted. Ongoing sleep dysregulation (total 8–9 h/24 h,
frequent wakings, short naps).
Development & Exam:
- Mobility: Crawls, pulls to stand, cruises; brief independent stand with tendency to toeIwalk.
- Movement quality: Diffuse sensorimotor difficulties—axial hypotonia, variable increased
extremity tone, poorly graded movements, diminished oralImotor control; mild brachycephaly.
- Behaviours: Rocking and headIbanging when seated; ‘transfixed’ stare; does not imitate
clapping/social games; guttural vocalizations, few consonants; no imitative vocal responses;
short attention span.
- Sensory/Autonomic: Hypersensitive to approach, loud noise, tactile contact; autonomic
overIarousal.
Impression:
Persistent sensorimotor dysregulation with emerging concerns in social attention and
prelinguistic communication; monitor for neurodevelopmental disorder.
DisciplineIspecific plan:
- Developmental clinic referral (12 months) for comprehensive MDT assessment.
- ParentImediated social play blocks (structured, repetitive games; copyIme) to leverage
strengths in structured imitation.
- Continue OT (sensory modulation; safe alternatives to headIbanging).
- Safety: Environmental modifications (soft corners; safe space) given risk of selfIinjury when
dysregulated.

Clinician: Laura Singh, CPSP
Patient: Ethan R. (Male)
Age at assessment: 13–15 months
Date of Service: 05-Mar-2024
Results:
- Preschool Language Scale (PLSI3) Standard Score: 81 (16th percentile); ageIequivalent ≈ 8
months for early receptive/expressive composites.
- MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory (CDI): Below 8Imonth level for
words/gestures (comprehension and production).
- Observation: No pointing, no conventional gestures, no nod/shake; no social imitation;
vocalizations not directed; does not request help when object inaccessible.
Impression:
Significant receptive and expressive delay with profound pragmatic/socialIcommunication
impairment; high suspicion for ASD.
DisciplineIspecific intervention plan:
- Joint attention (JA) and reciprocity: embed 2–3 JA trials/minute (showing, giving, gaze
alternation); shape functional requesting (reach → give → eye gaze → gesture).
- Gesture inventory: model/signs for ‘more’, ‘help’, ‘finished’; handIoverIhand prompts fading to
independent use.
- AAC exploration (early picture exchange/signs) to reduce frustration and support language
emergence.
- Parent coaching (8–12 weeks): imitate sounds/actions then expand; oneItoIone play at eye
level; strategic pauses; immediate reinforcement for look/gesture.
- Outcome targets (12 weeks): Initiate gesture or gaze shift to request in ≥3 contexts/day;
respond to name with gaze shift in ≥4/10 trials in a quiet room.

Clinician: Dr Aidan Rowe, PhD (Clinical)
Patient: Ethan R. (Male)
Age at assessment: 13–15 months
Date of Service: 20-Mar-2024
Assessment tools:
- Autism Diagnostic InterviewIRevised (ADIIR); Early Social Communication Scales (ESCS);
Joint Attention probes; social orienting tasks; nonverbal problemIsolving; speech perception;
imitation/object permanence; neuropsych tasks.
Key findings:
- ADIIR total: 27.5 → Meets criteria for autism across social reciprocity, communication, and
restricted/repetitive behaviours.
- ESCS & Joint Attention: Fails to initiate/respond to joint attention (no point/show; rare gaze
alternation).
- Social orienting: Missed 50% of social probes (name/clap) and 25% of nonIsocial probes
outside visual field.
- Nonverbal cognition: VisualIspatial ≈ 13Imonth level (near chronological age).
- Speech perception: Discriminates vowels; struggles with /r/–/l/ training (ageItypical difficulty).
- Imitation/Object permanence: Passes immediate imitation of novel acts (e.g., headItouch to
activate panel), AInotIB; borderline pass for higher serial displacement.
- Neuropsych: Visual paired comparison chose novel object 4/6 trials (limited trials). Delayed
response (working memory/inhibition): No reversal errors.
Formulation & plan:
- Marked socialIcommunication impairment with RRBs consistent with ASD. Relative strengths
in structured imitation and executive control tasks can be leveraged therapeutically.
- Begin autismIspecific early intervention with strong parentImediated component (daily short,
predictable sessions; heavy use of imitation and visual routines).
- Measurement plan: Track JA frequency, gesture repertoire, functional requests, and RRB
frequency weekly.
