Dear Dr Smith,

Thank you for referring Tom for neurodevelopmental assessment. They were seen at Our Clinic on 10/02/2024 and 17/02/2024 for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation to consider whether they meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Diagnostic Outcome
==================
Option B (Does Not Meet Criteria):
Based on the assessment findings, Tom does not meet diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). While they demonstrate significant difficulties with social communication, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities, these do not meet the threshold required for diagnosis. Alternative considerations include a diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder, which may better explain Tom's persistent difficulties with social interaction and communication.

DSM-5-TR Specifiers (if diagnosis confirmed)
---------------------------------------------
Not applicable, as Tom does not meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Assessment Team
===============
- Dr John Lee, Psychologist, Lead Assessor
- Ms Sarah Kim, Speech Pathologist, Contributing Assessor

Reason for Referral
===================
Tom was referred by you due to concerns regarding social communication differences, restricted interests, sensory sensitivities, and emotional regulation difficulties.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
Tom's pregnancy and birth were unremarkable. They were born at term with no neonatal complications. Early motor milestones were within normal limits. Language milestones were broadly on time, though parents report that Tom's early speech was unusually formal and pedantic. There is no history of seizures or significant medical illness.

Medical History
---------------
Tom has a diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), combined presentation, made at age seven. They have been taking stimulant medication, which has led to clear improvement in core ADHD symptoms. There is no other significant medical history.

Family History
--------------
Family history is notable for attentional difficulties in the father and an autism diagnosis in a maternal cousin.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
Tom is currently attending a mainstream school. They require ongoing support, and diagnostic clarification would assist in tailoring appropriate accommodations.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:
- Developmental and medical history interview with Tom's parents
- Clinical observation
- Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)
- Autism Diagnostic Interview (ADI-R)
- Review of prior reports, including the GP report, teacher report, parent report, speech pathology report, child psychologist report, and social worker report
- School observation and information from educational setting

Strengths
=========
Tom demonstrates significant strengths, including a good memory for detail, visual learning, honesty, loyalty, and persistence. They have specialist knowledge areas and show creativity in their interests.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
Tom demonstrates differences in back-and-forth conversation, sharing of interests/emotions/affect, and initiation/response to social interactions. They often dominate discussions with lengthy monologues about preferred topics and struggle to notice when peers lose interest.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
Tom shows differences in eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and integration of verbal and nonverbal communication. They have difficulty reading sarcasm or humour and take comments literally.

A3. Relationships:
Tom has difficulty developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships; adjusting behaviour to social contexts; and showing interest in peers. They struggle with reciprocal conversation, interpreting social cues, and adapting to group work.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
Tom does not demonstrate any significant motor stereotypies, echolalia, or repetitive use of objects.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
Tom becomes rigid about rules and procedures and may argue intensely if others do not follow their interpretation. They have difficulty with changes to routine and become highly distressed by timetable changes, substitute teachers, or altered routines.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
Tom has intense and narrow interests that dominate conversation. They become upset if interrupted and have difficulty shifting topics.

B4. Sensory differences:
Tom demonstrates significant sensory sensitivities, particularly to noise and clothing textures. They become visibly distressed in loud environments, such as assemblies or busy classrooms.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period): Symptoms have been present from early childhood, although they may not have been fully recognised until later.

Criterion D (Functional impact): Tom's symptoms cause clinically significant impact on social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.

Criterion E (Not better explained): Tom's difficulties are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay alone.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
Tom's current functioning is impacted by their difficulties with social communication, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities. They require ongoing support to manage their anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================
Tom has a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD, combined presentation. They also demonstrate significant anxiety, which is exacerbating their behavioural dysregulation. A diagnosis of Social (Pragmatic) Communication Disorder is considered, as it may better explain Tom's persistent difficulties with social interaction and communication.

Recommendations
===============
Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are made:
- Share the assessment findings with Tom's school to inform support planning and develop strategies to manage their anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties.
- Refer Tom for speech pathology assessment and intervention to address their social communication difficulties.
- Provide Tom with occupational therapy to support their sensory processing and motor skills.
- Offer Tom psychology support to address their anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties.
- Apply for NDIS funding to access ongoing support services.
- Provide Tom's family with education and support resources to help them understand and manage Tom's difficulties.

Summary
=======
In summary, Tom does not meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder. However, they demonstrate significant difficulties with social communication, restricted interests, and sensory sensitivities. Tom requires ongoing support to manage their anxiety and emotional regulation difficulties. The assessment findings and recommendations have been discussed with Tom and their family.

Dear Dr Smith,

Thank you for referring George for neurodevelopmental assessment. They were seen at our clinic on 10/02/2024 and 17/02/2024 for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation to consider whether they meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Diagnostic Outcome
==================
Option B (Does Not Meet Criteria):
Based on the assessment findings, George does not meet diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). While they demonstrate significant developmental delays, including limited expressive language and behavioural distress, these do not meet the threshold required for diagnosis. Alternative considerations include global developmental delay with sensory regulation difficulties.

DSM-5-TR Specifiers (if diagnosis confirmed)
---------------------------------------------
Not applicable, as George does not meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Assessment Team
===============
- Dr Emily Chen, Psychologist, Lead Assessor
- Ms Sarah Lee, Speech Pathologist, Contributing Assessor
- Ms Kate Brown, Occupational Therapist, Contributing Assessor

Reason for Referral
===================
George was referred by you due to concerns regarding significant developmental delays across multiple domains, limited expressive language, and behavioural distress. Early childhood educators and family have also queried possible autism spectrum disorder.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
George was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. There were no neonatal complications. Developmentally, George sat at approximately nine months and walked independently at around twenty months. Fine motor skills are delayed. Language delay is significant, with fewer than twenty consistent spoken words. Communication relies heavily on gesture and taking an adult by the hand.

Medical History
---------------
Medical history is notable for recurrent otitis media in early childhood. There is no history of seizures or major illness.

Family History
--------------
No relevant family history of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, learning difficulties, mental health conditions, or other neurodevelopmental conditions was reported.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
George attends daycare four mornings per week. They are generally gentle and affectionate with educators. Communication is primarily nonverbal, with George pointing, pulling adults by the hand, and vocalising to express needs. They follow simple instructions with gesture support and engage in parallel play, imitating peers in simple activities.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:
- Developmental and medical history interview with George's parents
- Clinical observation
- ADOS-2 and 3Di assessment tools
- Vineland-3 and Conners questionnaires completed by parents and educators
- Review of prior reports, including GP, teacher, parent, speech pathology, and child psychologist reports
- School observation and information from the educational setting

Strengths
=========
George is a loving and affectionate child who seeks comfort, enjoys physical affection, and responds to their name most of the time. They engage in simple social games and show social interest, although joint attention is emerging but inconsistent.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
George demonstrates some differences in back-and-forth conversation and sharing of interests/emotions/affect but does not meet the full criteria for social-emotional reciprocity difficulties.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
George's nonverbal communication skills, such as eye contact and gestures, are not significantly impaired.

A3. Relationships:
George develops, maintains, and understands relationships appropriately for their developmental level, showing social engagement and comfort-seeking behaviours.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
George exhibits repetitive object use, particularly twirling a cord for self-regulation, but this is considered more regulatory than stereotyped.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
George shows distress with transitions and has sensory sensitivities to noise and clothing but does not demonstrate a significant insistence on sameness or rigid thinking.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
George does not exhibit restricted or fixated interests.

B4. Sensory differences:
George has sensory differences, including hyper-reactivity to noise and hypo-reactivity to certain textures, but these are not considered sufficient to meet the criteria for autism spectrum disorder.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period):
While concerns were noted early in George's development, the symptoms do not clearly meet the criteria for being present from the early developmental period.

Criterion D (Functional impact):
George's symptoms cause significant impact on social and occupational functioning, primarily due to their developmental delays rather than autism-specific characteristics.

Criterion E (Not better explained):
George's difficulties are better explained by global developmental delay with sensory regulation difficulties rather than autism spectrum disorder.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
George's current functioning is significantly impacted by their developmental delays and sensory regulation difficulties. They require support in communication, daily living skills, and social participation. Contextual factors, such as the need for a structured environment and sensory integration strategies, act as both barriers and enablers to participation.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================
Global developmental delay with sensory regulation difficulties is considered the primary diagnosis. While autism spectrum disorder was a differential diagnosis, George does not meet the full criteria for this condition. Other conditions, such as developmental language disorder, are also considered based on the significant expressive and receptive language delays.

Recommendations
===============
Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are made:
- Share the assessment findings with George's school/SENCO to inform support planning.
- Speech pathology assessment and intervention for social communication and language development.
- Occupational therapy for sensory processing and motor skills development.
- Psychology support for anxiety and emotional regulation.
- Application for NDIS funding to access ongoing support services.
- Parent education and support resources to enhance understanding and management of George's needs.

Summary
=======
In summary, George does not meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder but instead presents with global developmental delay and sensory regulation difficulties. It is essential to recognize George's strengths, including their affectionate nature and social interest, and to provide targeted support to address their developmental needs. The assessment findings and recommendations have been discussed with George's family, and they have been provided with information about support options and relevant community resources.

Assessment Team
===============
- Jane Doe, Psychologist, Lead Assessor
- John Smith, Speech Pathologist, Contributing Assessor

Reason for Referral
===================
Brandon was referred by Dr Smith due to concerns regarding social communication differences, restricted interests, sensory sensitivities, and emotional regulation difficulties.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
Brandon's developmental history indicates that they spoke on time but with atypical pragmatics, including formal speech and monologues. Sensory sensitivities were evident from early childhood. Peer relationships have always been difficult, with escalating bullying and social isolation in later primary school.

Medical History
---------------
Brandon has no history of seizures or significant medical illness. Sleep is markedly dysregulated with delayed sleep phase. Appetite is inconsistent. They often refuse routine medical care due to sensory aversion. Previous medication trials have included an SSRI and stimulant medication, both discontinued due to intolerance and refusal. They are currently not taking psychotropic medication.

Family History
--------------
There is no relevant family history of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, learning difficulties, mental health conditions, or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
Brandon is enrolled in mainstream secondary education but is functionally unable to access schooling. Attendance is extremely limited, with gradual reduction from full timetable to brief, supervised visits. They require a quiet environment and a trusted adult to attend school.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:
- Developmental and medical history interview with Brandon's mother
- Clinical observation
- ADOS-2 and 3Di assessment tools
- SRS-2 and SCQ questionnaires completed by Brandon's mother and teacher
- Review of prior reports, including GP report, teacher report, parent report, speech pathology report, child psychologist report, and social worker report
- School observation and information from educational setting

Strengths
=========
Brandon is highly intelligent and has advanced structural language skills. They demonstrate specialist knowledge areas, particularly in mathematics and computing. They are also persistent and have a strong interest in their preferred topics.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
Brandon demonstrates differences in back-and-forth conversation, sharing of interests/emotions/affect, and initiation/response to social interactions. They have difficulty with reciprocal conversation and often use formal, technical language.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
Brandon demonstrates differences in eye contact, gestures, facial expressions, body language, and integration of verbal and nonverbal communication. They have minimal eye contact and use few gestures.

A3. Relationships:
Brandon demonstrates differences in developing, maintaining, and understanding relationships; adjusting behaviour to social contexts; interest in peers; imaginative play. They have difficulty with peer relationships and prefer to play alone.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
Brandon does not demonstrate any motor stereotypies, echolalia, repetitive use of objects, or idiosyncratic phrases.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
Brandon demonstrates distress with changes, rigid thinking, and rituals. They have a need for predictability and prefer to follow a routine.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
Brandon demonstrates intensity or focus of interests, preoccupations, and attachment to unusual objects. They have a strong interest in mathematics and computing.

B4. Sensory differences:
Brandon demonstrates hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input and unusual sensory interests. They are sensitive to noise and have difficulty with sensory integration.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period): Symptoms have been present from early childhood, even if not fully recognised until later.

Criterion D (Functional impact): Symptoms cause clinically significant impact on social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

Criterion E (Not better explained): Difficulties are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay alone.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
Brandon's current functioning is significantly impacted by their social communication and interaction difficulties, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour. They require support with social communication, daily living skills, and emotional regulation. They also require accommodations in their educational setting to access the curriculum.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================
Brandon has co-occurring anxiety and depressive symptoms, which require separate assessment and intervention. They do not meet criteria for ADHD or intellectual disability.

Recommendations
===============
Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are made:
- Share diagnosis with school/SENCO to inform support planning
- Speech pathology assessment/intervention for social communication
- Occupational therapy for sensory processing/motor skills
- Psychology for anxiety/emotional regulation support
- NDIS application/review of current NDIS plan
- Parent education and support resources
- Further assessment for co-occurring conditions

Summary
=======
In summary, Brandon does not meet diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder but demonstrates significant difficulties with social communication and interaction, and restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, consistent with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 1. They require support with social communication, daily living skills, and emotional regulation, and accommodations in their educational setting to access the curriculum.

The assessment findings and recommendations have been discussed with Brandon and their mother. They have been provided with information about autism, support options, and relevant community resources.

Dear Dr Chen,

Thank you for referring Noah for neurodevelopmental assessment. They were seen at our clinic on 10/02/2024 and 17/02/2024 for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation to consider whether they meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Diagnostic Outcome
==================
Option B (Does Not Meet Criteria):
Based on the assessment findings, Noah does not meet diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). While they demonstrate some residual vulnerabilities such as sensory sensitivity, literal interpretation of language, difficulty with peer conflict, and organisational challenges, these do not meet the threshold required for diagnosis. Alternative considerations include the presence of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), which contributes to impulsivity and executive dysfunction.

Not applicable, as Noah does not meet the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Assessment Team
===============
- Dr Sarah Lee, Psychologist, Lead Assessor
- Ms Jane Smith, Speech Pathologist, Contributing Assessor

Reason for Referral
===================
Noah was referred by Dr Chen due to concerns regarding social communication differences, restricted interests, sensory sensitivities, and emotional regulation difficulties.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
Noah was born at term following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. Early childhood was notable for poor sleep, feeding selectivity, limited spoken language, reduced joint attention, strong distress with transitions, and repetitive play behaviours. Sensory sensitivities to noise and clothing were prominent.

Medical History
---------------
There is no history of seizures or significant medical illness. Noah is currently prescribed stimulant medication for ADHD with good effect and tolerable side effects.

Family History
--------------
No relevant family history of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, learning difficulties, mental health conditions, or other neurodevelopmental conditions was reported.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
Noah currently attends mainstream schooling with supports. They are reading at grade level, participating in group activities, and forming peer relationships. Meltdowns have reduced in frequency and intensity. Noah independently uses coping strategies such as noise reduction and calm spaces.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:

- School observation and information from the educational setting

Strengths
=========
Noah's strengths include their enthusiasm for learning, ability to participate actively in class when structure is provided, and significant progress in reading and writing. They are also able to initiate play and are learning turn-taking skills. Noah's ability to use coping strategies independently is a notable strength.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
Noah demonstrates some difficulties with back-and-forth conversation and sharing of interests/emotions/affect. However, these difficulties do not meet the threshold for diagnosis.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
Noah's nonverbal communication skills, such as eye contact and gestures, are generally adequate.

A3. Relationships:
Noah is able to develop and maintain relationships, adjust behaviour to social contexts, and show interest in peers.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
Noah does not demonstrate any significant stereotyped or repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
Noah shows some distress with changes but is able to adapt with support.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
Noah's interests are not excessively restricted or fixated.

B4. Sensory differences:
Noah demonstrates some sensory sensitivities, particularly to noise.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period): Symptoms were present from early childhood.

Criterion D (Functional impact): Symptoms do not cause significant impact on social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.

Criterion E (Not better explained): Difficulties are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay alone.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
Noah's current functioning across relevant domains is generally adequate, with some residual vulnerabilities. They require ongoing support for sensory sensitivities, organisational challenges, and social interactions.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================

Dear Dr Matthews,

Thank you for referring Claude for neurodevelopmental assessment. They were seen at our clinic on 10/02/2024 and 17/02/2024 for a Comprehensive Needs Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation to consider whether they meet criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder and/or other neurodevelopmental conditions.

Diagnostic Outcome
==================
Option A (Positive Diagnosis):
Based on the assessment findings, Claude meets diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder as defined by the DSM-5-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2022). They demonstrate persistent differences in social communication and social interaction, along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. These characteristics have been present from early childhood and impact their everyday functioning.

Assessment Team
===============
- Dr A. Patel, Clinical Psychologist, Lead Assessor
- Ms R. Thompson, Speech Pathologist, Contributing Assessor

Reason for Referral
===================
Claude was referred by you due to concerns regarding poor eye contact, language delays, limited social interaction, repetitive behaviours, and sensory sensitivities.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
Claude was born preterm at 35-36 weeks gestation. Neonatal course was complicated by jaundice requiring phototherapy and persistent feeding difficulties. Early motor milestones were broadly within normal limits, with walking achieved around 12 months. Language development has been significantly delayed, with fewer than a handful of recognisable words. Joint attention behaviours have been notably absent, with limited pointing to share, rare showing of objects, and inconsistent response to name. Progressive deterioration in social engagement was noted after approximately six months of age.

Medical History
---------------
Claude's medical history includes prematurity, neonatal jaundice, and persistent feeding difficulties. There is no history of seizures or regression. Sleep is significantly disrupted, with Claude sleeping only approximately 8-9 hours per 24-hour period. Diet is highly selective with texture aversions. Physical examination has noted mildly increased muscle tone and a persistent neonatal positive support reflex.

Family History
--------------
Family history is notable for motor coordination and attention difficulties in the father, OCD and depression in a paternal aunt, and a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome in an older brother.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
Claude attends early childhood education (kindergarten). They predominantly play alone with minimal peer interaction. Communication is primarily nonverbal. Play is exploratory and sensory-based, including mouthing toys and spinning objects. Attention span is very brief, approximately 1-2 minutes. Claude functions best with consistent routines and becomes distressed with changes.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:
- Developmental and medical history interview with Claude's parents
- Clinical observation
- Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R)
- Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)
- Preschool Language Scales (PLS)
- Review of prior reports, including GP referral report, kindergarten teacher report, speech pathology report, child psychologist report, and social worker report
- Observations from the educational setting

Strengths
=========
Claude is an affectionate child who seeks comfort from familiar caregivers. They show curiosity and engagement with sensory-based play activities. Claude responds to their name most of the time and engages in simple social games with trusted adults. Their family is deeply committed and well-resourced, providing a stable and supportive home environment.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
Claude demonstrates profound impairment in social-emotional reciprocity. Joint attention is absent, with no pointing to share interest and rare showing of objects. Social referencing is not observed. Reciprocal social interaction is markedly limited, with Claude showing minimal response to social overtures from peers or unfamiliar adults.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
Claude shows significant differences in nonverbal communication. Eye contact is poor and inconsistent. Gestural communication is absent, with no use of conventional gestures such as waving or nodding. Integration of verbal and nonverbal communication is markedly impaired.

A3. Relationships:
Claude has significant difficulty developing peer relationships. They predominantly play alone, show minimal interest in other children, and do not engage in cooperative or imaginative play. Social engagement is primarily limited to familiar caregivers.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
Claude exhibits repetitive sensory-based play, including mouthing toys, spinning objects, and a strong interest in wheels. These behaviours are frequent and occupy a significant portion of their play time.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
Claude becomes significantly distressed with changes to routine. They require consistent daily routines and predictable environments to function.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
Claude shows intense interest in certain objects, particularly wheels and spinning toys. These interests are narrow and occupy a disproportionate amount of their attention.

B4. Sensory differences:
Claude demonstrates significant sensory differences, including sensitivity to loud noises, aversion to unexpected touch, apparent insensitivity to pain, and selective eating related to texture.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period): Symptoms have been present from early infancy, with concerns first noted around six months of age and progressive social withdrawal observed thereafter.

Criterion D (Functional impact): Claude's symptoms cause clinically significant impact across all domains of functioning, including communication, social participation, play, daily living skills, and early learning.

Criterion E (Not better explained): Claude's difficulties are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay alone. While developmental delay is present, the pattern of social communication impairment and restricted/repetitive behaviours is consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
Claude's current functioning is significantly impacted across all domains. Communication is predominantly nonverbal, with overall language performance at approximately an 8-month developmental level representing a significant delay. Daily living skills require substantial adult assistance. Social participation is markedly limited. Claude requires a structured, predictable environment with consistent routines and intensive support across all developmental domains.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================
Claude presents with significant language impairment, with PLS scores at the 16th percentile and functional communication well below age expectations. Oral-motor difficulties have been present since infancy. Sleep disturbance is a significant concern. Global developmental delay is present but does not fully account for the pattern of social communication impairment and restricted/repetitive behaviours observed.

Recommendations
===============
Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are made:
- Commence intensive early intervention, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) or equivalent evidence-based program.
- Speech pathology intervention focusing on functional communication and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies.
- Occupational therapy for sensory processing, feeding difficulties, and motor skills development.
- Parent training and education to support implementation of strategies in the home environment.
- Application for NDIS funding to access intensive ongoing support services.
- Sleep support and management strategies, with consideration of referral to a paediatric sleep specialist.
- Share the assessment findings with Claude's early childhood education setting to inform support planning.
- Provide the family with information about parent support groups, respite care options, and mental health support.
- Review in 6 months to monitor progress and adjust support plan as needed.

Summary
=======
In summary, Claude meets the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2, with accompanying language impairment. They demonstrate persistent and significant differences in social communication and interaction, along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour. Claude requires substantial support across all domains of functioning. Their family is deeply committed and would benefit from comprehensive support services to optimise Claude's developmental outcomes.

The assessment findings and recommendations have been discussed with Claude's parents. They have been provided with information about autism, support options, and relevant community resources.

Reason for Referral
===================
Robert was referred by you due to concerns regarding feeding difficulties, fluctuating muscle tone, sensory reactivity, limited social attention, and delays in prelinguistic communication.

Background Information
======================

Developmental History
---------------------
Robert's early developmental course was notable for feeding difficulty, fluctuating tone, and sensory reactivity identified from 2.5 months of age. Motor milestones were delayed, with immature sensorimotor integration documented at 4 months. Prelinguistic communication development has been significantly delayed, with emerging but inconsistent social attention and limited communicative intent. Joint attention behaviours have been slow to develop.

Medical History
---------------
Robert's medical history includes symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux with documented acid reflux episodes identified on pH study at 4 months. Sleep and state regulation have been poor from early infancy. Hearing assessment (BAER) at 12 months was normal. Genetic testing including Fragile X was negative. Neurological review at 9 months documented persistent sensorimotor dysregulation with emerging concerns in social attention.

Family History
--------------
No relevant family history of autism, ADHD, intellectual disability, learning difficulties, mental health conditions, or other neurodevelopmental conditions was reported.

Educational/Occupational History
--------------------------------
Robert attends an early childhood education setting. They require significant support across all aspects of the program. Participation in group activities is limited. Robert engages primarily in solitary sensory-based play and requires consistent adult assistance for transitions and daily routines.

Assessment Process
==================
The following assessment methods were used:
- Developmental and medical history interview with Robert's parents
- Clinical observation
- Autism Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R)
- Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2)
- Mullen Scales of Early Learning
- Preschool Language Scales (PLS-3)
- Bayley Scales of Infant Development
- Review of prior reports, including paediatric neurology reports, occupational therapy report, sleep and gastroenterology report, audiology and genetics report, speech pathology report, and clinical psychology report

Strengths
=========
Robert shows curiosity about their environment and engages with sensory-based play materials. They demonstrate emerging social interest, with intermittent responses to familiar adults. Robert's family is committed and proactive, having engaged with multiple services from a very early age. Their early identification and intervention pathway is a significant protective factor.

Assessment Findings Against DSM-5-TR Criteria
=============================================

Criterion A: Social Communication and Interaction
-------------------------------------------------
A1. Social-emotional reciprocity:
Robert demonstrates significant impairment in social-emotional reciprocity. Reciprocal social interaction is markedly limited. Response to social overtures is inconsistent. Sharing of interests and emotions is minimal. Communicative intent is largely absent, with limited use of vocalisations or gestures for social purposes.

A2. Nonverbal communication:
Robert shows significant differences in nonverbal communication. Eye contact is inconsistent and poorly integrated with other communicative behaviours. Gestural communication is minimal. Facial expressions are limited in range and not consistently used for communicative purposes.

A3. Relationships:
Robert has significant difficulty developing peer relationships. Social engagement is primarily limited to familiar caregivers and is inconsistent even in these contexts. They do not engage in cooperative play and show limited interest in other children.

Criterion B: Restricted, Repetitive Behaviours
----------------------------------------------
B1. Stereotyped/repetitive movements, speech, or use of objects:
Robert exhibits repetitive sensory-based play behaviours and repetitive manipulation of objects. These behaviours are frequent and occupy a significant proportion of their play time.

B2. Insistence on sameness, routines, ritualised patterns:
Robert shows significant distress with transitions and changes to routine. They require predictable environments and consistent daily schedules to manage their arousal and state regulation.

B3. Restricted, fixated interests:
Robert's play interests are narrow and repetitive, focused primarily on sensory exploration of objects rather than functional or imaginative play.

B4. Sensory differences:
Robert demonstrates significant sensory differences, including hyper-reactivity to auditory and tactile input, poor state regulation, and texture aversion in feeding. These sensory differences have been documented from early infancy.

Additional DSM-5-TR Criteria
----------------------------
Criterion C (Early developmental period): Symptoms have been present from early infancy, with concerns first documented at 2.5 months of age and persistent across all subsequent assessments.

Criterion D (Functional impact): Robert's symptoms cause clinically significant impact across all domains of functioning, including communication, social participation, play, daily living skills, and early learning.

Criterion E (Not better explained): Robert's difficulties are not better explained by intellectual disability or global developmental delay alone. While global developmental delay is present with a Mullen Early Learning Composite of 63 (1st percentile), the pattern of social communication impairment and restricted/repetitive behaviours is consistent with Autism Spectrum Disorder beyond what would be expected from developmental delay alone.

Current Functioning and Support Needs
=====================================
Robert's current functioning is significantly impacted across all developmental domains. Cognitive assessment places overall development at the 1st percentile. Language functioning shows significant receptive and expressive delay, with PLS scores at the 16th percentile and profound pragmatic impairment. Robert requires substantial support for communication, daily living skills, social participation, and learning. They require a structured, predictable environment with intensive support.

Co-occurring Conditions and Differential Diagnosis
==================================================
Robert presents with co-occurring global developmental delay, with Mullen ELC of 63 (1st percentile) and Bayley MDI of 82 (12th percentile) at earlier assessment. Significant language impairment is present across both receptive and expressive domains. Gastroesophageal reflux and feeding difficulties are ongoing medical concerns. Sensorimotor integration difficulties have been documented from early infancy.

Recommendations
===============
Based on the assessment findings, the following recommendations are made:
- Commence intensive early intervention, including Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) or equivalent evidence-based program.
- Speech pathology intervention focusing on functional communication and augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies.
- Occupational therapy for sensory processing, feeding difficulties, and motor skills development.
- Continued paediatric neurology follow-up for monitoring of sensorimotor development.
- Continued gastroenterology management for reflux and feeding difficulties.
- Parent training and education to support implementation of strategies in the home environment.
- Application for NDIS funding to access intensive ongoing support services.
- Share the assessment findings with Robert's early childhood education setting to inform support planning.
- Provide the family with information about parent support groups and community resources.
- Review in 6 months to monitor progress and adjust support plan as needed.

Summary
=======
In summary, Robert meets the diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder, Level 2, with accompanying intellectual impairment and language impairment. They demonstrate persistent and significant differences in social communication and interaction, along with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, evident from early infancy. Robert requires substantial support across all domains of functioning. Early identification and the family's proactive engagement with services are significant strengths that will support Robert's developmental trajectory.

The assessment findings and recommendations have been discussed with Robert's parents. They have been provided with information about autism, support options, and relevant community resources.
